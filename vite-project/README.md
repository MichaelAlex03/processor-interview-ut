# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Prerequisites

Before using make sure you run the command "npm i" to download all needed packages to run this app
If "npm i" doesnt work manually install all packed with "npm i + package name" (Packages include: axios, papaParse, react, react-dom, react-router-dom)
